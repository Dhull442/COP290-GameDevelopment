#Into the Darkness:
A game in which the player plays by the perspective of a blind person with only a stick available to direct them.
The game is currently thought of being a maze solving puzzle game but can be amended later on.

### Key Features:
- The person will have a stick and his height might be varied which varies the parts where the stick can reach.
- The person can also take help of a cat or dog in some levels. Various levels will be introduced into the game.
- There will be proximity sounds that will also help him in moving around.
- As he hits the objects with his stick, he will see sense the objects boundaries which will be shown as red impressions in the complete dark world as seen by him and the impressions will always fade away quickly whose time will increase as the person progresses.
- The game is currently 2D but can be easily extended to 3D.
- Integration of different platforms can also be done using unity. < this might probably fetch us a lot of marks >
- Database handling and UI should be cute and minimalistic. The design of player and objects are also to be done.
